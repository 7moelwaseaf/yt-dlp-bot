![frames](assets/download_success.png)

## üòÇ Features 
* Download videos from any [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) supported website
* Trigger video download by sending link to the Telegram bot or by API call
* Upload downloaded videos to Telegram
* Track download tasks in the database or API
* Everything is run in Docker containers

## ‚öô Quick Setup
1. Create Telegram bot using [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and get your `token`.
2. [Get your own Telegram API key](https://my.telegram.org/apps) (`api_id` and `api_hash`)
3. Find your Telegram User ID [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32683992/find-out-my-own-user-id-for-sending-a-message-with-telegram-api).
4. Copy `bot/config-example.yml` to `bot/config.yml`.
5. Write `token`, `api_id`, `api_hash` and your User ID to `bot/config.yaml` by changing respective placeholders.
6. Check the default environment variables in `envs` directory and change if needed (especially default credentials).
7. Video storage path (`STORAGE_PATH` environment variable) is located in `envs/.env_common` file.
By default, it's `/filestorage` path inside the container. What you want is to map the real path to this inside the `docker-compose.yml` file for `worker` service e.g.
if you're on Windows, next strings mean container path `/filestorage` is mapped to
real `D:/Videos` so your videos will be saved to your `Videos` folder.
8. If you want your downloaded video to be uploaded back to Telegram, set `UPLOAD_VIDEO_FILE`
environment variable in `.env_common` file to `True`.
```yml
  worker:
    ...
    volumes:
      - "D:/Videos:/filestorage"
```

## üèÉ Run
Simple as `docker-compose up -d`. 

Your telegram bot should send you a startup message:
`<YOUR_BOT_NAME> bot started, paste video URL to start download` and that's it.
After pasting video URL bot will send you appropriate message whether it was downloaded or something went wrong.


## Advanced setup

1. If you want to change `yt-dlp` download options, go to the `worker/ytdl_opts`
directory, copy content from `default.py` to `user.py` and modify as you wish 
by checking [official documentation](https://github.com/timethrow/yt-dlp/blob/patch-1/README.md#embedding-yt-dlp).

## üõë Failed download
If your URL can't be downloaded for some reason, you will see this

## Access
 - API: default port `1984` and no auth. Port can be changed in `docker-compose-yml`
 - RabbitMQ: default creds are located in `envs/.env_common`
 - PostgreSQL: default creds are located in `envs/.env_common`. Same creds are stored for Alembic in `alembic.ini`.
 - PGAdmin: default creds are located in `docker-compose.yml`

## API
By default, API service will run on your `localhost` and `1984` port.
